Here we are using the programming language Go (golang.org) to implement a framework for agent-based simulation.

Agent-based simulation is one of my major research area and I’ve used a wide range of tools to implement and run the simulation models.

    NetLogo
    AnyLogic
    Python (own framework implementation)
    …

With the language Go on the rise and given it’s performance and toolset, I’m going to give it a try and to reimplement the Python code base to Go.

First testrun of a airspace simulation:

More to come. Stay tuned.
