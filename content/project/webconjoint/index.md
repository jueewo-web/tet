### *WebConjoint* 

*WebConjoint* measures preferences implicitly. This is crucial when (product) features need to be traded mutually. Many real-world decisions require to trade one feature for another, e.g. high quality and low price are precluding each other, so it’s necessary to trade quality for price or vice versa. Traditional measurements (e.g. surveys, interviews, etc.) are testing features separately (itemized). In the case of related features, traditional tools produce incorrect results.   The interactive tool WebConjoint is using a joint measurement of how the features of products and services are mutually traded. It provides a correct measure of the preferences and gives an insight into the customer's decision making.
